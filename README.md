# Operating-Systems
A collection of code I wrote while taking an OS class at the University of Tennessee - Knoxville. All in all, this is about 80% of the code for an actual operating system. It contains scheduling, finding and reading data from the disk, a memory management unit (MMU), the universal asynchronous receiver-transmitter (UART), and more!
